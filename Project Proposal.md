# The Conceptual Library

## Abstract

I came up with an idea of a one stop shop for all my studying needs. I realized that when I was studying at my most effective that I would have some music or white noise going, with a todo list, and a separate list so I could write down the random thoughts that would enter my head to google later, and a timer to keep me accountable for a time amount to study. I realized that this study style could be put together into a single tool.

The name comes from the idea that I tend to work best in a library and there there is a sense of accountability when I come into one. The term conceptual library came about when realizing that I could experiment with the concept of a dedicated place of learning and knowledge. 

## Background

- #### Prior Works By Others
	-  https://pomofocus.io/
		- This site has a pomodoro timer with a to do list below
	- Video about the Flowmodoro Timer - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dkYI2OECZo&t=332s
		- This technique is based around the concept of 'flow' mainly accredited to phycologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi in the 1970s. Wikipedia defines flow as "Flow ... is the mental state in which a person performing some activity is fully immersed in a feeling of energized focus, full involvement, and enjoyment in the process of the activity."
- #### Personal Prior Works
	- I developed my own flowmodoro timer using TypeScript in the "Applied Programing Class." It was buggy and never fully worked right. I think I tried to fix it but haven't worked on it sense that class.

## Description

This project is going to be a study aid with the hope that it will be the homebase of your studying. The hope is the less often that you have to open YouTube or Spotify for "study music" or have to create a new todo list you are able to then have a digital space where you are accountable as soon as you enter in the same way a library can be. A detailed description can be found below

- Stack
	- Frontend
		- React framework using JavaScript
			- Picked because of it's popularity and based on how many internships said that this is a technology that they use.
	- Backend
		- .Net Backend using C#
			- This was also picked based on the number of employers who said they use this but also picked to try and improve on my C# skills.
- Minimal Viable Requirements
	- Pomodoro and other study Timers
	- Task and Distraction List
		- The distraction list is the things that your brain thinks up that you would rather be doing (such as googling when the first grandfather clock was invented). I like having a destraction list as it makes me less impulsive to act on every single thought that enters into my head.
	- Music and soundscape (white noise, campfire, creek sounds) player
	- Backend to track study sessions and store mp3 files.
- Stretch Goals
	- AI implementation
		- Give feedback to user on study factors they could improve (time of day, type of task, courses that need help)
		- Have a feature where you can upload pdf and have it read to you
		- ChatGPT API
	- API Implementation
		- Spotify
		- Canvas
		- ChatGPT

#### Target Audience

Obviously it's based around students. I think however it would be a waste to corner this off only to students, especially as more work is becoming remote or online. I think that there is also a growing market of home schoolers who could use a better study tool, especially if their class load in online. 

#### Success Criteria

If I could get a well designed website hosted, with a timer, the lists, and have studies tracked by a database that would be an absolute win in my book.
